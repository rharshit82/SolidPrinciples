    "pseudocode": "Implementing Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in pseudocode involves following these key points:\n\n1. Identify the Responsibilities: Clearly define the different responsibilities of a class or module.\n\n2. Separate Responsibilities: Ensure that each responsibility is handled by a separate class or module.\n\n3. Define Interface: Define an interface or contract for each class or module that specifies the methods and properties it provides.\n\n4. Delegate Responsibly: If a responsibility requires collaboration with other classes or modules, delegate the specific tasks to the appropriate classes.\n\n5. Limit Dependencies: Minimize the dependencies between classes by only relying on the necessary interfaces and not directly accessing the internal implementation details of other classes.\n\nThe pseudocode example below illustrates the implementation of SRP:\n\n```plaintext\nClass Order {\n    var items = []\n\n    // Add an item to the order\n    function addItem(item) {\n        items.append(item)\n    }\n\n    // Calculate the total price of the order\n    function calculateTotalPrice() {\n        var total = 0\n        for each item in items {\n            total += item.price\n        }\n        return total\n    }\n}\n\nClass Item {\n    var name\n    var price\n\n    // Constructor for creating an item\n    constructor(name, price) {\n        this.name = name\n        this.price = price\n    }\n}\n\nfunction main() {\n    // Create an order\n    var order = new Order()\n\n    // Add items to the order\n    var item1 = new Item(\"Item 1\", 10)\n    var item2 = new Item(\"Item 2\", 20)\n    order.addItem(item1)\n    order.addItem(item2)\n\n    // Calculate and print the total price of the order\n    var totalPrice = order.calculateTotalPrice()\n    print(\"Total Price: \" + totalPrice)\n}\n```\n\nIn the above pseudocode, the `Order` class is responsible for managing the items in an order and calculating the total price. The `Item` class encapsulates the details of an individual item. This separation of responsibilities allows for better modularity and maintainability in the codebase, as each class handles its specific responsibility independently.",
    "javascript": "Implementing single responsibility in JavaScript involves following these key points:\n\n1. Dividing code into smaller, more focused units: Break down your code into smaller functions, classes, or modules, each responsible for a specific task or functionality. This helps to ensure that each unit has a single purpose or responsibility.\n\n2. Separation of concerns: Keep different concerns or functionalities separated from each other. For example, avoid mixing DOM manipulation with data processing logic. Instead, create separate functions or modules to handle these distinct responsibilities.\n\n3. Encapsulation: Encapsulate functionality within modules or classes. This helps to isolate and contain code related to a specific responsibility, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n\n4. Modular design and composition: Use a modular design approach, where different modules can be composed together to build larger systems. This allows for more flexibility and reusability of code, as well as easier testing and debugging.\n\n5. Loose coupling: Reduce dependencies between modules to establish loose coupling. This means minimizing the direct interaction and reliance of one module on another. Instead, use well-defined interfaces or contracts to communicate between modules.\n\n6. High cohesion: Aim for high cohesion within each module by ensuring that all its internal components or functions are closely related and work towards the same responsibility. This makes the code more readable, maintainable, and easier to reason about.\n\nBy implementing the single responsibility principle in JavaScript, you can improve code quality, make it more modular and reusable, enhance maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of bugs or errors.",
    "java": "Implementing single responsibility in Java involves the following key points:\n1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The SRP states that a class should have only one responsibility or reason to change. This means that a class should only have one specific task or responsibility and should not be responsible for multiple unrelated tasks. This promotes better maintainability, reusability, and testability of the code.\n2. Separation of Concerns: Java classes should be designed in a way that each class focuses on a specific concern or responsibility. This helps in creating modular and loosely coupled code that is easier to understand and maintain.\n3. Modularity: Breaking down complex functionalities into smaller, focused classes helps in achieving modularity. Each class should be responsible for only one specific part of the functionality and should interact with other classes using well-defined interfaces.\n4. Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves hiding the internal details and providing a public interface to interact with the class. This way, the class only exposes the methods or properties that are relevant to its responsibility, and the internal implementation details are hidden.\n5. Collaboration and Composition: Instead of having a single class that does everything, applying the single responsibility principle encourages collaboration between multiple classes that work together to achieve the desired functionality. Classes that have single responsibility can be composed together to form more complex behavior.\n6. Testing: Classes with single responsibility are often easier to test since the responsibilities are well-defined and isolated. This allows for more focused and targeted unit tests, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\nBy following these key points, developers can design and implement Java classes that adhere to the single responsibility principle, resulting in more maintainable, reusable, and testable code.",
    "python": "The key points for implementing single responsibility in Python are as follows:\n\n1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, thus promoting modular and maintainable code.\n2. By adhering to SRP, each class or module should have a unique and clearly defined responsibility.\n3. Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, single-purpose classes or functions helps to improve code readability, reusability, and testability.\n4. A class or module should be responsible for a highly cohesive set of functionalities that are related and do not violate SRP.\n5. One effective way to achieve SRP is to separate different concerns such as input/output, data storage, data manipulation, and user interface into separate classes or modules.\n6. Each class or module should have a well-defined interface and should interact with other components through clearly defined methods or functions.\n7. Applying SRP allows for easier maintenance, as modifying one class or module does not affect other parts of the codebase.\n8. SRP helps in reducing code complexity and increasing code clarity, making it easier for future developers to understand and modify code.\n9. The SOLID principles, of which SRP is the first, promote good software engineering practices and improve code quality.\n\nImplementing SRP in Python involves analyzing the responsibilities of your code components, identifying areas where responsibilities can be separated, and refactoring the code accordingly.

    "csharp": "To implement the single responsibility principle (SRP) in C#, the following key points should be considered:\n\n1. Single Responsibility: Each class should have a single reason to change. It should be responsible for only one thing or performing one specific task. This helps to keep the codebase modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.\n\n2. Separation of Concerns: Split the responsibilities of a system into different classes or modules. Each class should handle a specific role or functionality, making it easier to manage and test. This promotes code reusability and reduces code duplication.\n\n3. Cohesion: Classes and methods should have high cohesion, meaning that they should contain only related and closely related code. Group related functionalities together, and separate unrelated functionalities into different classes.\n\n4. Encapsulation: Use encapsulation to hide the implementation details of a class. Provide only the necessary public interfaces for other components to interact with. This ensures that each class is responsible for its own data and behavior, minimizing dependencies.\n\n5. Modular Design: Break down the system into smaller and self-contained modules, each with a specific responsibility. This makes it easier to test and maintain the code. A good practice is to follow the SOLID principles, where SRP is one of the key principles.\n\n6. Single Point of Change: By adhering to the SRP, changes that are required due to a specific responsibility can be isolated within a single class. This reduces the chances of introducing bugs or unintended side effects to other parts of the system.\n\n7. Code Reusability and Maintainability: SRP promotes code reusability as each class focuses on a specific responsibility. It also improves maintainability, as changes required for a specific responsibility can be made in isolation without affecting other components.\n\nImplementing SRP in C# results in cleaner, more cohesive, and maintainable code. It reduces complexity, improves testability, and enhances overall software quality.",
    "php": "Implementing single responsibility in PHP refers to structuring your code so that each class or module has only one responsibility or reason to change.\n\nKey points for implementing single responsibility in PHP:\n\n1. Class Responsibility: Each class should have only one specific responsibility or purpose. This helps in keeping the code focused and easier to understand, test, and maintain. For example, a \"User\" class should solely handle user-related functionality, such as registration, login, or profile management.\n\n2. Separation of Concerns: Separate different concerns or functionalities into separate classes or modules. This improves code reusability and prevents the ripple effect of changes. For instance, if you have a class that handles both user authentication and sending email notifications, it's better to separate these responsibilities into two distinct classes.\n\n3. Open-Closed Principle: Code should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that when requirements change or new features need to be added, existing classes should not be modified. Instead, new classes should be created or existing ones extended. This allows for easier maintenance and non-disruptive changes.\n\n4. Modular Design: Break down complex functionalities into smaller, independent modules that adhere to the single responsibility principle. Each module should represent a specific task or behavior and be easily testable in isolation. This improves code efficiency and reduces dependencies between different parts of the application.\n\n5. Single Responsibility and Method Length: Methods within a class should also follow the principle of single responsibility. Each method should have a clear and concise purpose, making the code more readable and maintainable. If a method becomes too long and handles multiple responsibilities, consider breaking it into smaller methods or creating new classes.\n\n6. SOLID Principles: Single responsibility is one of the SOLID principles, which are guidelines for designing and writing maintainable software. Understanding and applying all five SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) can lead to more robust and flexible PHP code.\n\nBy implementing single responsibility in PHP, you can create modular, maintainable, and flexible code, making it easier to scale, refactor, and collaborate on software projects.",

Each class should have only one reason to change: A class should have a single responsibility or purpose. It should encapsulate a single concept or perform a specific task. This helps in maintaining code coherence and makes it easier to reason about the class's behavior.\n\n2. Separate concerns into different classes: If a class is responsible for multiple tasks, it becomes harder to understand, test, and maintain. Splitting the functionality into separate classes with well-defined responsibilities improves modularity and makes the code more flexible.\n\n3. Encapsulation and information hiding: Proper encapsulation ensures that each class exposes only the methods and properties relevant to its responsibility. By hiding unnecessary implementation details, we avoid unnecessary coupling between different parts of the system.\n\n4. Keep functions and methods focused: Functions and methods should only perform a specific and well-defined task. By limiting the scope of functions, we increase readability, reusability, and maintainability of the code.\n\n5. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle for interfaces: Interface design should also adhere to SRP. Each interface should define a cohesive set of methods that relate to a single purpose. This allows for better decoupling and implementation flexibility.\n\n6. Use design patterns and architectural patterns: Applying design patterns like the Adapter, Decorator, or Strategy pattern can help separate responsibilities into different classes. Similarly, embracing architectural patterns like the Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-Presenter (MVP) can assist in achieving better separation of concerns.\n\n7. Write modular, testable code: By adhering to SRP, individual classes become easier to test in isolation. This leads to more reliable and maintainable code. Furthermore, unit testing can be performed more efficiently, as specific responsibilities can be targeted with focused tests.\n\nBy following these key points, you can effectively implement the single responsibility principle in C++ code.

Separation of Concerns: Split the functionality of your program into distinct concerns. Each concern should be encapsulated to handle a specific part of the application. This separation makes the code more modular and easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n3. Avoid God Objects: Avoid creating \"God Objects\" that handle multiple responsibilities. Instead, break down the functionality and distribute it across multiple smaller objects, allowing for better code organization and reusability.\n\n4. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Apply the SRP to your functions and methods. Each function or method should have a single responsibility and should do it well. If a function or method starts to handle multiple concerns, refactor it into smaller functions or methods.\n\n5. Use Interfaces: Define interfaces to abstract functionality and dependencies. This allows for loose coupling between components and facilitates easy substitution of implementations, making the code more flexible and maintainable.\n\n6. Modularity and Composition: Break down your code into smaller, reusable modules that have a single responsibility. Then, compose these modules to build more complex systems.

Each class or module should have only one responsibility: The primary principle of SRP is to ensure that each class or module has a single, well-defined responsibility. This makes the code more maintainable, testable, and reusable.\n\n2. Identify and define responsibilities: Before implementing SRP, it is essential to carefully identify and define the responsibilities of each class or module. This can be done by analyzing the requirements and understanding the specific functionality the class or module should handle.\n\n3. Delegate responsibilities to separate classes: Once the responsibilities are identified, it is crucial to delegate them to separate classes or modules. This separation promotes better code organization, encapsulation, and modularity.\n\n4. Encapsulate related functionality: Encapsulation plays a vital role in SRP. It involves grouping together related functionality within a class or module and hiding the internal implementation details.\n\n5. Strive for low coupling and high cohesion: To achieve SRP, it is important to minimize dependencies between classes or modules (low coupling) and ensure that each class or module is focused on a specific task (high cohesion).\n\n6. Follow the Open-Closed Principle (OCP): The SRP is closely related to OCP, which states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. By adhering to OCP, we ensure that implementing new responsibilities can be done without altering existing code.\n\n7. Use SOLID principles as guidelines: SRP is one of the SOLID principles, which are commonly used guidelines for writing maintainable and scalable software.

Identify responsibilities: Before writing code, carefully analyze the requirements and identify the distinct responsibilities that need to be implemented. Each responsibility should be isolated and encapsulated within its own class.\n\n3. Separation of concerns: The responsibilities within a class should be cohesive and related to each other. If a class handles multiple responsibilities, it becomes harder to understand, test, and maintain. Therefore, separating responsibilities allows for clearer code organization.\n\n4. Encapsulation: Each class or module should expose only the necessary public interfaces related to its responsibility.

Collaboration between classes: If multiple classes are required to accomplish a task, they should collaborate using well-defined interfaces. This promotes loose coupling, making the codebase more flexible, modular, and easier to maintain.\n\n6. Refactoring: If an existing class violates the single responsibility principle, consider refactoring the code to extract responsibilities into separate classes. This can be done gradually and iteratively to avoid introducing bugs or impacting existing functionality.\n\n7. Testing: Single responsibility classes are easier to test as they have a well-defined purpose. Unit tests can be written to validate the behavior of each responsibility independently.\n\nBy following these key points and adhering to the single responsibility principle, the codebase becomes more maintainable, modular, flexible, and easier to understand, test, and extend.",

Define concise and focused modules: Structure your codebase into smaller, purposeful modules. Each module should have a clear responsibility and encapsulate related functionality.\n\n2. Encapsulate data and functionality: By utilizing Rust's struct and enum types, you can encapsulate data and related methods within a single unit. This helps in maintaining the single responsibility principle by ensuring that responsibility is contained within an entity.\n\n3. Avoid god objects: God objects refer to classes or structs that encompass multiple responsibilities and have knowledge about various aspects of the system. Instead, aim for smaller, narrowly-focused objects, reducing complexity and improving code maintainability.\n\n4. Honor Rust's ownership and borrowing system: Rust's ownership and borrowing rules are instrumental in enforcing single responsibility. By adhering to these rules, you can ensure that each object has a clearly defined scope and avoids unnecessary responsibilities.\n\n5. Use traits and trait objects: Traits in Rust enable defining common behavior that can be implemented by multiple types. By utilizing traits and trait objects, you can separate responsibilities into reusable components, enhancing code modularity and reducing duplication.\n\n6. Employ composition over inheritance: Inheritance can lead to objects inheriting multiple responsibilities, violating the single responsibility principle.

Create concrete subclasses that inherit from the base class or implement the interface.\n\n3. Keep the original code untouched, without making any modifications.\n\n4. When new functionality is needed, create a new subclass or implementation of the base class or interface.\n\n5. Add a mechanism to dynamically choose the appropriate subclass or implementation based on requirements (e.g., factory pattern or dependency injection).\n\n6. Utilize polymorphism to allow the use of the new subclass without modifying existing code.\n\nHere's an example pseudocode implementation:\n\n```\n// Step 1: Define base class or interface\nabstract class Shape {\n    abstract float area();\n}\n\n// Step 2: Create concrete subclasses\nclass Circle : Shape {\n    float radius;\n    \n    Circle(float radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n    \n    float area() {\n        return 3.14 * radius * radius;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Rectangle : Shape {\n    float length;\n    float width;\n    \n    Rectangle(float length, float width) {\n        this.length = length;\n        this.width = width;\n    }\n    \n    float area() {\n        return length * width;\n    }\n}\n\n// Step 3: Original code remains untouched\n\n// Step 4: Create new subclass\nclass Triangle : Shape {\n    float base;\n    float height;\n    \n    Triangle(float base, float height) {\n        this.base = base;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n    \n    float area() {\n        return (base * height) / 2;\n    }\n}\n\n// Step 5: Choose appropriate subclass dynamically\nShape shape;\nif (userInput == \"circle\") {\n    shape = new Circle(5);\n} else if (userInput == \"rectangle\") {\n    shape = new Rectangle(4, 6);\n} else if (userInput == \"triangle\") {\n    shape = new Triangle(3, 7);\n}\n\n// Step 6: Utilize polymorphism\nfloat shapeArea = shape.area();\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates the open-closed principle by allowing new shapes (e.g., Triangle) to be added without modifying the existing code, and by dynamically selecting the appropriate subclass based on user input.",
    "javascript": "The Open Closed Principle (OCP) is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In the context of JavaScript, implementing the OCP involves the following key points:\n\n1. Encapsulation: The first step to achieving the OCP in JavaScript is to encapsulate the behavior that is likely to change in the future. By encapsulating code within objects or modules, we can create modules that are closed for modification and only expose certain interfaces or APIs for extension.\n\n2. Abstraction and Inheritance: JavaScript supports object-oriented features like abstraction and inheritance. Applying the OCP in JavaScript involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define the common behavior of related objects. By using inheritance, specific behaviors can be extended or overridden in subclasses without modifying the original code.\n\n3. Polymorphism: JavaScript allows for dynamic typing, which means that objects can be treated as different types based on their capabilities. Applying OCP involves leveraging polymorphism to write code that can work with different types of objects without making changes to the base code.\n\n4. Dependency Inversion: To follow the OCP, JavaScript code should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. By using dependency injection or inversion of control principles, the dependencies of a module can be provided at runtime, allowing different implementations to be substituted without modifying the main code.\n\n5. Use of design patterns: Design patterns like the decorator pattern, strategy pattern, or observer pattern can help to implement the OCP effectively in JavaScript.

These areas should be encapsulated into modular and reusable abstractions.\n\n2. Design classes and functions with a clear purpose: Ensure that each class or function has a well-defined responsibility and a single reason to change. This helps in isolating changes to specific areas and allows for easier extension.\n\n3. Favor composition over inheritance: Use composition, where objects are composed of other objects, instead of relying heavily on inheritance. This allows for a more flexible and decoupled design, as objects can be composed and extended dynamically.\n\n4. Implement abstractions and contracts: Define abstract base classes (ABCs) or interfaces that define the behavior or contract that other classes should adhere to.

Identify areas prone to future changes: Analyze the software system to identify the parts that are more likely to undergo changes in the future. These areas should be the focus of applying the OCP.\n\n2. Use abstraction: Introduce abstractions, such as protocols or base classes, to define a common interface for related entities. By programming to the abstraction rather than concrete implementations, you can easily extend or replace components without modifying existing code.\n\n3. Encapsulate varying behavior: Separate the parts of your code that are likely to change behind interfaces. This allows you to add new functionality or modify existing behavior without modifying the existing code. Using protocols and interfaces helps achieve this encapsulation.\n\n4. Use inheritance and composition: Inheritance can be used to extend the behavior of existing classes, but this should be done judiciously to prevent tight coupling and fragility. Composition, on the other hand, is a more flexible approach where functionality is provided by composing multiple independent components.\n\n5. Follow SOLID principles: The Open Closed Principle is part of a set of principles called SOLID, and they work together. Applying all the SOLID principles can help ensure a codebase that is flexible, maintainable, and robust.\n\nBy following these key points, you can better adhere to the Open Closed Principle in your Swift code, resulting in code that is more modular, maintainable, and easier to extend in the future.",

This means that adding new functionality should be achieved by extending the existing classes rather than modifying their code.\n\nIn Ruby, there are several ways to implement the open closed principle:\n\n1. Inheritance: By using inheritance, new functionality can be added to existing classes without modifying their code. Ruby supports single inheritance, so a new class can be created by inheriting from the existing class, overriding its methods, and adding new ones.\n\n2. Modules and Mixins: Ruby supports multiple inheritance through modules. Modules can be included in classes using the `include` keyword, allowing them to add new behavior to the class without modifying its code directly.\n\n3. Duck Typing: Ruby's dynamic typing and duck typing feature allow you to implement the open closed principle by focusing on the behavior of objects rather than their specific types. If an object responds to a particular method, it can be considered to have the required behavior and can be used interchangeably.\n\n4. Decorators: Decorators are a design pattern that allows you to add functionality to an object dynamically. In Ruby, decorators can be implemented using modules and the `prepend` method, which allows you to prepend a module's methods to the class's method lookup chain.\n\nBy following these approaches, developers can adhere to the open closed principle in Ruby, allowing for more maintainable and extensible code.",
    "rust": "The open closed principle is a software design principle that encourages code to be open for extension but closed for modification. When it comes to implementing this principle in Rust, the following key points should be considered:\n\n1. Use traits and trait objects: In Rust, traits allow you to define a set of methods that types can implement, providing a common interface. By leveraging traits and trait objects, you can write code that is open for extension through implementing new types, while keeping existing code closed for modification.\n\n2. Implement the \"interface segregation principle\": In Rust, it is often recommended to split a large trait into smaller, more specific traits. This helps in applying the interface segregation principle, which states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Breaking down traits into smaller ones allows different sets of methods to be implemented independently, promoting code that is open for extension on specific aspects but closed for modification as a whole.\n\n3. Use polymorphism to decouple dependencies: Polymorphism is a powerful concept that allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of a common base type. In Rust, you can achieve polymorphism through trait objects or generics. By decoupling dependencies through polymorphism, you can write code that is open for extension by introducing new types, while keeping existing code modules closed for modification.\n\n4. Apply the \"dependency inversion principle\": The dependency inversion principle suggests depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. In Rust, this can be achieved through the use of traits and generics. By programming against traits and abstract types rather than concrete implementations, you allow the possibility of introducing new implementations without modifying existing code that relies on those abstractions.\n\nOverall, implementing the open closed principle in Rust involves leveraging traits, trait objects, interface segregation, polymorphism, and dependency inversion. By following these principles, you can write Rust code that is flexible, maintainable, and open for extension while remaining closed for modification."

Here are the key points to keep in mind when implementing LSP in pseudocode:\n\n1. Use Inheritance: Create a superclass that defines a common interface and behavior for multiple subclasses. The subclasses should inherit from the superclass.\n\n2. Limit Preconditions: The preconditions (input requirements) of the superclass methods should not be strengthened in the subclass methods. If the superclass expects certain inputs, the subclass should not require more specific or restricted inputs.\n\n3. Relax Postconditions: The postconditions (output guarantees) of the superclass methods should not be weakened in the subclass methods. If the superclass guarantees certain outputs, the subclass should ensure the same or stronger guarantees.\n\n4. Avoid Exceptions: The subclass methods should not throw any additional or broader exceptions than the superclass methods. If the superclass method throws a specific exception, the subclass method should either throw the same exception or a subclass of it.\n\n5. Preserve Behavioral Consistency: The behavior of the subclass methods should match or extend the behavior of the superclass methods. The subclass should not introduce new behaviors that are not present in the superclass.\n\nHere's a pseudocode example demonstrating the implementation of LSP:\n\n\nclass Shape:\n    method draw():\n        // Common implementation for all shapes\n        ...\n\nclass Circle inherits Shape:\n    method draw():\n        // Implements drawing a circle\n        ...\n\nclass Rectangle inherits Shape:\n    method draw():\n        // Implements drawing a rectangle\n        ...\n\nfunction main():\n    shape1 = Circle()\n    shape2 = Rectangle()\n    \n    drawShapes(shape1, shape2)\n\nfunction drawShapes(shape1, shape2):\n    shape1.draw()\n    shape2.draw()\n```\n\nIn this example, the superclass `Shape` defines a common interface for the subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` using the `draw` method.

This means that the subtype should adhere to the behavior and contracts specified by its parent, without introducing new or modified expectations.\n\n2. Method Signatures: The methods in the subtype should have the same function signatures as the methods in the parent type. This ensures that code relying on the parent class can be used interchangeably with its derived classes.\n\n3. Pre- and Post-conditions: Any preconditions specified by the parent type should not be strengthened in the subtype. Likewise, any postconditions specified by the parent should not be weakened. This guarantees that the behavior defined by the parent class is preserved in its derived classes.\n\n4. Exception Types: If the parent class declares exceptions to be thrown, the derived class should only throw the same or narrower exception types. This allows clients of the parent class to safely handle exceptions without worrying about different exception types being thrown by its derived classes.\n\n5. Avoid Violating the LSP: To avoid violating the LSP in JavaScript, it's important to design class hierarchies carefully and ensure that derived classes don't introduce new behaviors that are incompatible with their parent classes.

Inheritance Hierarchy: Ensure that the subclass is a true subtype of the superclass, meaning that it fulfills all the contracts and behaves in a manner consistent with the superclass. This includes implementing all the methods and interfaces defined by the superclass.\n\n2. Method Contract Preservation: The subclass should not weaken or alter the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants of the methods declared in the superclass. It is crucial to adhere to the same method signatures and ensure compatible return types and exceptions.\n\n3. Exception Handling: If a method in the superclass does not throw any exceptions, its overridden method in the subclass should not throw any additional checked exceptions. This is important to guarantee that client code relying on the superclass is not disrupted.\n\n4.

Inheritance and Polymorphism: C# supports inheritance, which allows derived classes to inherit properties and methods from their base classes. Polymorphism enables objects of derived classes to be treated as objects of their base classes.\n\n2. Contractual Responsibilities: LSP emphasizes that derived classes must fulfill the contractual responsibilities defined by the base class. This means that a derived class should implement all the methods and properties defined in the base class and maintain the same behavior.\n\n3. Subtype Compatibility: A derived class should be a subtype of its base class, meaning it should support at least all the behaviors and operations expected from the base class. This ensures that objects of the derived class can be used in any context where objects of the base class are expected.\n\n4. Avoidance of Stronger Preconditions and Postconditions: LSP states that a derived class should not impose stronger preconditions (input requirements) or weaker postconditions (output guarantees) than its base class. The behavior and expectations defined by the base class should still hold true for the derived class.\n\n5. Proper Overrides: When overriding methods in a derived class, it is important to adhere to the contract defined by the base class. The method signature, including the return type and parameters, should remain the same, and the behavior should be consistent.\n\n6. LSP Violation Consequences: Violating LSP can lead to unexpected behaviors, incorrect program logic, and difficulties in code maintenance and extensibility. LSP violations can result in code smells, such as duplicated code or complex conditional statements, which can make the codebase harder to understand and maintain.\n\n7. Design by Composition: Sometimes, LSP can be better implemented by using composition (HAS-A relationship) instead of inheritance (IS-A relationship).

Follow the \"is-a\" relationship: The derived class must be able to be used wherever the base class is expected. This means that the derived class should inherit from the base class only if it fully qualifies as a subtype of the base class. For example, if you have a base class named `Animal` and a derived class named `Dog`, it should make sense to say that a `Dog` is an `Animal`.\n\n2. Preserve behavior of base class: The derived class should not alter the behavior of the base class in a way that violates the intended usage of the base class methods. Any method defined in the base class should be usable in the derived class without causing unexpected behavior or breaking any preconditions or postconditions.\n\n3. Avoid strengthening preconditions: The derived class should not impose stricter constraints on method parameters compared to the base class. If the base class method expects a certain input and behaves correctly with that input, the derived class should not require more specific or limited inputs for its implementation.\n\n4. Do not weaken postconditions: The derived class should not reduce or weaken the guarantees or promises made by the base class methods. If the base class method provides a specific return value or promises certain behavior, the derived class should maintain or enhance those guarantees, but never diminish them.\n\n5. Override methods with caution: When overriding a base class method in the derived class, ensure that the derived class implementation adheres to the LSP. The overridden method should accept the same input parameters, return the same type, and provide at least the same level of functionality as the base class method. Avoid throwing exceptions that are not declared in the base class method.\n\n6. Use contracts and documentation: Clearly define the contracts and expectations for the base class methods, including preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.

In Go, this means that any function or method that accepts a parameter of the base type should be able to work correctly with any instance of the derived type.\n\n2. Consistent Method Signatures: Subclasses in Go should adhere to the same method signatures as their base classes.

Prioritize a cohesive and modular design, where each class has a clear responsibility and a minimal set of methods and dependencies.\n\nBy adhering to the ISP, PHP code becomes more maintainable, flexible, and easier to understand and extend. It promotes better code organization, reduces coupling, and improves the overall design of the system.",
    "cpp": "The interface segregation principle (ISP) is a software development principle that promotes the segregation of interfaces into smaller, more focused ones, rather than having a single, large interface. This principle aims to reduce the dependencies between modules or classes and results in more maintainable, flexible, and reusable code.\n\nIn C++, there are several key points to consider when implementing the ISP:\n\n1. Identify cohesive responsibilities: Divide the operations and responsibilities of a class or module into smaller, more cohesive groups. Each group should represent a specific role or functionality.\n\n2. Create specialized interfaces: Create separate interfaces for each group of responsibilities. These interfaces should only contain methods that are relevant to the specific group.\n\n3. Implement only required interfaces: Classes should only implement the interfaces that are necessary for their functionality. This approach prevents classes from being burdened with unnecessary methods, leading to a cleaner and more focused codebase.\n\n4. Avoid imposing unnecessary dependencies: Avoid imposing unnecessary dependencies on classes by only exposing the required interface(s) to other modules or classes. This reduces coupling and allows for easier maintenance and extension of the codebase.\n\n5. Use inheritance or composition: Implement the ISP by utilizing inheritance or composition to achieve the desired behavior. Inheritance can be used when a class shares common behavior with another class, while composition allows for more flexibility by allowing class instances to have references to specific interfaces.\n\n6. Refactor and review: Regularly review and refactor the codebase to ensure adherence to the ISP. As the system evolves, it is important to evaluate if interfaces have become too large or if dependencies have been introduced. Constantly applying the ISP ensures that the codebase remains flexible and maintainable.\n\nOverall, the key points in implementing the interface segregation principle in C++ involve identifying cohesive responsibilities, creating specialized interfaces, minimizing dependencies, and utilizing inheritance or composition appropriately. By following these guidelines, developers can achieve cleaner, more decoupled code that is easier to maintain and extend.",
    "go": "The interface segregation principle (ISP) is an important concept in Go that promotes the idea of designing fine-grained interfaces that are specific to the needs of each implementing component. The key points to consider when implementing ISP in Go are as follows:\n\n1. Create interfaces that are small and cohesive: Instead of defining a single large interface, break it down into smaller, more focused interfaces that represent specific behaviors or capabilities. This allows components to implement only the interfaces that are relevant to them, reducing unnecessary dependencies.\n\n2. Avoid \"fat\" interfaces: Fat interfaces contain methods that are not required by all implementing components. This violates ISP as it forces components to implement functionalities they don't need. By keeping interfaces lean and precise, you prevent coupling between unrelated components.\n\n3. Use embedding to compose interfaces: Go allows interfaces to be composed through embedding. This enables the creation of new interfaces that combine multiple smaller interfaces. By doing so, you can define interfaces that are tailored to specific use cases without polluting them with unrelated methods.\n\n4. Consider client-specific interfaces: When implementing ISP, consider creating interfaces that are specifically tailored for individual clients or usage scenarios. This allows clients to interact with components through interfaces that perfectly match their requirements, ensuring better code encapsulation and maintainability.\n\n5. Embrace the power of interfaces in testing: One advantage of ISP is that it promotes easier testing. With small, focused interfaces, you can easily mock or stub dependencies during testing, providing a better way to isolate and test components in isolation.\n\nBy adhering to the interface segregation principle, you can achieve greater modularity, flexibility, and maintainability in your Go code. It encourages a more granular approach to interface design, enabling components to expose only the methods that are truly relevant for their intended use.",
    "swift": "The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in Swift refers to the practice of designing interfaces that are specific to the needs of the clients, avoiding interfaces that are too large and contain unnecessary methods or properties. The key points of implementing ISP in Swift include:\n\n1. Identify specific client requirements: Begin by understanding the specific needs of the clients who will be using the interface. This includes identifying the methods or properties they require and those they don't.\n\n2. Split the interface into smaller, specialized interfaces: Based on the identified requirements, split the large interface into smaller, more focused interfaces. Each interface should contain only the methods or properties that are relevant to a particular client or group of clients.\n\n3. Clients only depend on the interfaces they need: Clients should only depend on the interfaces that provide exactly what they require. By doing so, unnecessary dependencies are avoided and clients are not burdened with methods or properties they don't use.\n\n4. Class or struct implements multiple interfaces: The class or struct implementing the interfaces can implement multiple small interfaces instead of a single large one. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability as different combinations of interfaces can be used based on different client needs.\n\n5. Use protocol inheritance: In Swift, protocols can inherit from other protocols. This allows for creating a hierarchy of protocols, where more specialized protocols inherit properties and methods from more general ones. This helps in organizing and defining interfaces based on common functionality.\n\nImplementing the Interface Segregation Principle in Swift ensures that interfaces are lean, focused, and tailored to the needs of specific clients. It promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces the risk of breaking existing code when adding new functionality.",

In Ruby, implementing ISP involves the following key points:\n\n1. Identify and group related methods: Analyze your classes and identify methods that are conceptually related and often used together. Group these methods into cohesive interfaces.\n\n2. Create smaller, specialized interfaces: Instead of having a large interface with multiple methods, break it down into smaller, more specific interfaces. Each interface should represent a distinct behavior or responsibility.\n\n3. Implement only the relevant interfaces: Ensure that clients only depend on the interfaces that are necessary for their functionality. By implementing only the relevant interfaces, you avoid unnecessary dependencies and reduce the risk of having to modify the entire class when a change is made to an unrelated interface.\n\n4. Use mixins or modules: In Ruby, mixins and modules are powerful tools for implementing ISP. By creating separate modules for each interface, you can include only the relevant modules in your classes, thus adhering to the principle.\n\n5. Refactor existing code: If you have existing code that violates ISP, refactor it by extracting the relevant methods into separate interfaces and then including those interfaces where needed. This will make your codebase more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.\n\nBy following these key points and adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle, you can design more flexible and robust Ruby code that is easier to maintain and extend.",
    "rust": "The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in Rust is a design principle that suggests clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Here are the key points to implementing ISP in Rust:\n\n1. Identify client-specific needs: Determine the specific requirements and functionalities that each client (or consumer) of an interface needs. This involves understanding the different use cases of the interface.\n\n2. Separate interfaces based on client needs: Instead of having a single, monolithic interface, split it into smaller, more focused interfaces that cater to the specific needs of different clients. Each interface should contain only the methods and functionality required by a particular client.\n\n3. Avoid implementing unnecessary methods: When implementing an interface, ensure that no methods are included that a particular client does not need. This helps prevent unnecessary dependencies and keeps the interface lightweight.\n\n4. Use traits to define interfaces: In Rust, traits are used to specify an interface. Use trait objects to represent different subsets of functionality required by specific clients. This allows for flexibility and promotes decoupling between the clients and the objects they depend on.\n\n5. Optimize interface usage: By implementing ISP, you can optimize the usage of the interface by reducing coupling and minimizing unnecessary dependencies. This results in cleaner and more maintainable code, as well as improved performance and flexibility.\n\nOverall, implementing the Interface Segregation Principle in Rust involves analyzing client needs, separating interfaces accordingly, and using traits to define focused interfaces.

    "javascript": "The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) in JavaScript is an important design principle that aims to decouple high-level modules from low-level modules, promoting reusability, flexibility, and maintainability within an application. Here are the key points to consider when implementing DIP in JavaScript:\n\n1. Abstraction: Create abstract interfaces or classes that define the behavior or contract for a particular set of functionalities. These abstractions should describe what the module needs, rather than how it is implemented.\n\n2. Dependency Injection (DI): Instead of creating and managing dependencies within a module, dependencies are injected from the outside. This allows for better control and flexibility, as different implementations can be easily swapped into the module without modifying its core code.\n\n3. Inversion of Control (IoC): The control of creating and managing instances of dependencies is inverted. Instead of modules directly creating their dependencies, they rely on a container or framework to provide and manage these dependencies. This promotes loose coupling and modular design.\n\n4. Separation of Concerns: DIP helps in separating high-level business logic from low-level implementation details. The high-level modules depend on abstractions, while the low-level modules implement those abstractions. This allows for easier maintenance and testing of individual modules.\n\n5. Dependency Inversion vs. Dependency Injection: Dependency Inversion is the broader concept, while Dependency Injection is the technique used to achieve it.

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules: Instead, both should depend on abstractions. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.\n\n2. Abstractions should not depend on details: When creating interfaces or abstract classes, they should not rely on specific implementations. This allows for interchangeable components and facilitates future changes.\n\n3. Inversion of control: A key aspect of DIP is the use of inversion of control (IoC) containers or frameworks. These frameworks manage object creation and dependency injection, ensuring that dependencies are satisfied without the modules having to explicitly create or know about each other.\n\n4. Dependency injection: Java provides various ways to perform dependency injection, such as constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection. These mechanisms allow for the injection of dependencies into objects, reducing tight coupling and making it easier to replace or modify dependencies.\n\n5.

In C#, this is achieved through dependency injection, where dependencies are supplied through constructor parameters, property injection, or method parameters.\n\n2. Abstraction and interfaces: To apply DIP effectively, you should define abstractions and interfaces that represent the behavior expected from dependencies.

Dependency Injection: Implementing dependency injection is another key step towards adhering to the DIP. This involves passing dependencies into a class from external sources, rather than creating them internally.
