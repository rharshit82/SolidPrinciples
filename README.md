Welcome to the repository for [solidprinciples.org](https://solidprinciples.org), an educational platform dedicated to sharing and improving knowledge about the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. Our website, built with Next.js, serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and applying SOLID principles, complete with examples, real-world scenarios, and expert commentary.

## SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five principles that help software developers design maintainable and extendable classes. They are the foundation of software development, aiding developers in avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and developing scalable systems. 

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **O**: Open-Closed Principle
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

Learn more about SOLID principles on our [website](https://solidprinciples.org).
